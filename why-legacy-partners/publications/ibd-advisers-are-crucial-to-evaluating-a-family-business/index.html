	<h1>IBD: Advisers Are Crucial To Evaluating A Family Business</h1>
		<p><strong>February 22, 2013<br />
By Gary M. Stern, For Investor&#8217;s Business Daily<br />
<a href="http://news.investors.com/management-financial-adviser-briefing/022213-645418-financial-advisers-help-sell-retain-family-firms.htm" target="_blank">Original Source</a></strong></p>
<p>When financial advisors evaluate a family business, most focus on its financial value. Its liquid assets, annual performance and impact on retirement savings are what most zero in on. But that&#8217;s not the full story of determining a family business&#8217; worth, says Patrick Ring, president of Legacy Partners, a Baltimore-based investment management firm.</p>
<p>The family business must generate healthy returns and rising revenue. But evaluating its full financial value includes succession planning, just like public companies.</p>
<p>At the same time, many family firms avoid succession planning. Deciding who will take over the business when a founder or owner retires is filled with anxiety and complexity. Avoiding the issue can lead to a company&#8217;s eventual demise or severe tax consequences.</p>
<p>Too many investment advisers fail to consider &#8220;the end game for the business. Is the business going to be retained in family ownership and control, or will it be sold?&#8221; Ring said.</p>
<p><strong>Giving Up The Baton</strong></p>
<p>Many owners in their 50s, 60s and 70s are immersed in their business, appreciate the financial returns, and view it as &#8220;their baby&#8221; or another offspring. They want it to last forever, but it can&#8217;t, Ring says.</p>
<p>The financial adviser should ask the long-term owner, &#8220;What would you like to see happen to your business?&#8221; and then listen carefully to the answer. Most owners will open up and discuss what they&#8217;d like to do with their firm in the future. The follow-up question is, &#8220;How can we make that happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>Most investment advisers are qualified money managers. But deciding the future ownership of the family business, whether it&#8217;s a restaurant, hardware store or candy company, is critical to evaluating it.</p>
<p>If the family opts to keep it, ownership can play out in a variety of ways. The owner can devise stock certificates and distribute them to his children, or leave the business to them in trust, or sell it to their offsprings. &#8220;If someone pays for the business, they have their skin in the game,&#8221; Ring says.</p>
<p>Many long-term owners fear that they won&#8217;t know what to do with themselves after they sell. The adviser needs to be sympathetic and explore the options for the next step — a family investment company, a new business, split the business, sell part, keep part, etc. That builds excitement and momentum.</p>
<p>Taxes are also important to consider. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to pay more taxes than you have to,&#8221; Ring said, and that may include adding a tax expert to the team.</p>
<p><strong>When To Sell</strong></p>
<p>If no children are interested in managing a business, boosting its value to sell is the logical next step. Family businesses often need to be groomed, enhanced and updated to generate additional value. &#8220;When investment bankers or buyers review it, it must jump off the page,&#8221; Ring said.</p>
<p>When owners turn the business over to children, there are several traps that loom. If an owner transfers control to his children and the sons or daughters don&#8217;t want to manage people and aren&#8217;t skilled in business, it can tank quickly. &#8220;The business can crash and take the owners down with it,&#8221; Ring said.</p>
<p>If there aren&#8217;t any children or they&#8217;re disinterested, other options include selling a business to its employees or setting up an employee stock ownership plan, or ESOP. Owners can also sell 50% of their control to a manager who runs it, while keeping half.<br />
Creating stock ownership and a family council that discusses future control issues can provide a transition while the founder keeps the reins. The family can discuss governance and what it wants to do long-term with it. It can also appoint a separate board that serves in an advisory capacity.</p>
<p>Lincoln Warrell, the 81-year-old chairman of Camp Hill, Pa.-based Warrell Corp., which makes Pennsylvania Dutch, Katherine Beecher and other candy brands, sought investment advice because &#8220;we&#8217;re in the candy business, not investment management.&#8221; Warrell wanted an expert&#8217;s financial evaluation on what the family business was worth, despite the fact that his primary goal was to avoid selling it.<br />
Three family members of Warrell&#8217;s seven children are involved in the business. Two children and a son-in-law serve as vice presidents in the candy business, though an outsider, Patrick Huffman, is its president and COO. When Huffman retires in two years, Warrell&#8217;s children will split his duties.</p>
<p>When investment manager Ring (who&#8217;s also a member of the board) outlined the tax consequences of selling the family business to an outside firm, Warrell paid close attention. Succession planning &#8220;is an easy subject to avoid. No one lives forever,&#8221; Warrell said.<br />
Based on the adviser&#8217;s advice, Warrell gave shares of the business to his children, arranged a family council consisting of major shareholders, which meets twice a year. An outside evaluator was also hired to interview the top executives of the company to review how they like their job and where they&#8217;d like to be in the future.</p>
<p>But for many business owners, selling or relinquishing control is anxiety-provoking. &#8220;Many owners of closely held businesses for 30 years or longer haven&#8217;t gotten to the point that they can be excited about what&#8217;s next for them,&#8221; Ring said. So holding on to it is the easier alternative.</p>
<p>The goal of the financial adviser in such situations is clear: engage the client and become part of the solution.</p>
